Entry 1:
	After some Googling online, I have decided to implement the game Hangperson. Everyone's favorite PC alternative to that wretched game Hangman /s.

Entry 2:
	It's late, but I have finished with the main body of code. Now comes sprucing it up and working on the GUI.

Entry 3:
	Finished this iteration of the game, updating this to 1.1 now. The game is fully functional, and plays fairly well. There are 6 total solutions, but that is easily configurable  with just a few changes. To the game parameters module.
